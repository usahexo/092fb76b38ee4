#  NHL Star Dominik Hasek Plans to Reopen Hollywood Casino Grantville

Dominik Hasek, the NHL Hall of Fame goalie, plans to reopen the Hollywood Casino Grantville in 2020. The casino closed in 2006 after Hasek’s ownership group filed for bankruptcy.

The casino will offer 2,000 slot machines and 60 table games. It will also have a five-star hotel with 250 rooms and a 10,000-square-foot spa.

Hasek is no stranger to the casino business. He has been involved in gambling since his teenage years in the Czech Republic. After playing for multiple teams in the NHL, he retired in 2008 and moved to Las Vegas, where he opened two casinos.

“I am really looking forward to this project and bringing back jobs to the area,” said Hasek. “The Hollywood Casino Grantville was a big part of this community for many years and I am excited to bring it back to life.”

The project is expected to create 300 jobs.

The Hollywood Casino in Grantville is set to reopen on December 1st after a $16 million renovation. The casino will now feature a new sports bar, restaurant and event center, all designed by NHL legend Dominik Hasek.

"The goal was to create a destination that would appeal to people from all over eastern Pennsylvania," Hasek said.

The new sports bar, called D.H. Sports Grill, will have 50 televisions and a menu of classic American pub food. The restaurant, called Grantville Station, will serve modern American cuisine with a focus on local ingredients.
