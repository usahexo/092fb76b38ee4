In the world of soccer, Brazil is a perennial powerhouse. Teams around the world have long feared the "magical" Brazilian players who can make seemingly impossible plays look easy. Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, and Philippe Coutinho are just a few of the stars on Brazil's current roster, and they give fans plenty of reasons to be hopeful that their team can win this year's World Cup.

Backed by nearly 1,700 odds from sports betting site Betfair, Brazil is currently favored to win this year's World Cup. Other countries in the running include Germany (with odds of 5/2), Spain (7/2), France (4/1), and England (9/1).

Brazil has yet to claim a World Cup victory since 2007, but many experts believe that this could be their year. The team has looked strong in recent tournaments, and they are coming into this year's World Cup with a lot of momentum. Their first game is against Switzerland on June 17th, and all eyes will be on Neymar and his teammates as they look to make history.

#  1700 odds shut out gambling fans looking for underdog bet

The NHL's Atlantic Division is home to the biggest upset in sports gambling so far this year. The odds of the Tampa Bay Lightning, who were at 1700 to 1, shutting out the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 3 were just too good for bettors to pass up.

"It was a complete shock," said John, a Maple Leafs fan from Toronto. "I had no idea they were going to win."

Despite the loss, John still cashed in on his bet.

"At least I made a little bit of money off it," he said. "I'm not sure what I would have done if they actually won."

For sports fans looking for an underdog to back, the NHL's Atlantic Division is not the place to look. The odds of any team other than the Tampa Bay Lightning winning are just too long.

#  1700 odds mean Germany is almost a sure thing to win the World Cup

A lot has been said about the chances of teams in this year’s World Cup, but one country keeps popping up as a favorite: Germany. With odds at 1700, Germany is almost a sure thing to win the World Cup.

Some might say that these odds are only because Germany is the host country and that they have an automatic advantage. But even when you look at odds without home country advantage, Germany is still a clear favorite.

France is a close second with odds at 1000, while Brazil lags behind at 400. This could be in part due to Brazil’s recent string of losses; they were eliminated from the 2014 World Cup by Germany, and lost in the semifinals of the 2016 Copa America Centenario.

Despite these losses, Brazil is still considered a strong contender for this year’s cup. They are one of the most successful countries in World Cup history, having won 5 championships – more than any other team. In addition, they have some of the best players in the world including Neymar Jr. and Philippe Coutinho.

But even with Brazil’s impressive roster, it seems that Germany is still favored to win. This could be due to their current form; they are currently on a 10-game winning streak dating back to last year’s World Cup. Additionally, they are coming into this year’s cup as reigning champions – something that has never happened before.

All of this being said, there is always room for surprises in tournaments like the World Cup. So don’t be surprised if another team comes out on top – especially with so much competition this year.

#  1700 odds increase Costa Rica's chance of making it to the final rounds

After upsetting Italy in their opening match, Costa Rica has now surprised the world by defeating Uruguay, who were heavily favored to win. This has caused their odds of making it to the final rounds to increase significantly, from 1700/1 to 100/1.

This is a huge upset for the South American powerhouse, who saw much of their offense disappear without Luis Suarez. The absence of the Liverpool striker was clearly felt, as Edison Cavani was unable to create any real chances for his team.

Costa Rica will now face England in their final group match. A victory would see them through to the next round as group winners, while a draw or loss would mean that they would need help from either Italy or Uruguay to make it through.

#  1700 odds make Argentina a stronger contender for the championship

The 2017 Confederations Cup is down to its semifinal rounds, with four of the world’s top soccer nations competing for the chance to play in the final. Among these countries is Argentina, who have some of the best odds of winning the cup.

At 1700 odds, Argentina is a stronger contender than Spain (2500), Germany (3500), and Brazil (4000). While it may seem surprising that Germany is only a 3500 favorite after winning the 2014 World Cup, they are up against strong competition in this year’s cup.

Brazil, for example, has not been doing well in recent tournaments. They were eliminated from the 2016 Olympics in the group stage and failed to make it out of the Copa América Centenario quarterfinals last year. This leaves them at fourth place in the CONMEBOL World Rankings, behind Argentina (3rd), Chile (5th), and Colombia (8th).

Spain, on the other hand, had a disappointing exit from Euro 2016 when they lost to Italy in penalties. They have also dropped in rank since their first-place finish in the FIFA World Rankings in 2013.

Germany has been doing better recently, but they are not as dominant as they once were. Their current rank of second place may be enough to win them this cup – but it is by no means a guarantee.

This means that Argentina has good chances of winning the Confederations Cup this year – especially considering that they have not yet won it. Head coach Jorge Sampaoli will be looking to clinch his first major title with the team and cement his place as one of Argentina’s greatest coaches ever.
