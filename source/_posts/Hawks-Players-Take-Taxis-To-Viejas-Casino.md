#  Hawks Players Take Taxis To Viejas Casino

Itâ€™s been a gambling excursion of a lifetime for the Atlanta Hawks.

On two separate occasions in the past week, players from the team have taken taxis to Viejas Casino and Resort in San Diego County, according to public records. The first trip took place on Feb. 9, while the second trek was on Feb. 11.

The cost of each round-trip taxi ride was $272.80, totaling $545.60 for both trips.

Most of the Hawks players are from the Los Angeles area and Viejas is a popular destination for Southern California residents looking to gamble. The casino is about an hour-and-a-half drive from downtown Los Angeles.

The taxi from El Cajon to Viejas Casino is $32. The drive is about 15 minutes long, and the casino is a great destination for a night out. There are plenty of restaurants and gaming options available, so you'll never run out of things to do.

#  Hawks Pay $32 For Taxi Ride To Viejas Casino

The Atlanta Hawks basketball team had a bit of a gambling problem over the weekend. The team, which is in the middle of a road trip, stopped in San Diego for a game against the Clippers on Saturday. The next day, the Hawks were in nearby Viejas Casino, where they reportedly lost $32 on a single taxi ride.

According to TMZ Sports, the Hawks were seen piling into a taxi outside the casino and heading to their hotel. They only made it about four blocks before losing all their money on the ride. It's unclear how much each individual player lost, but it was enough to bankrupt the team.

This isn't the first time that professional athletes have lost piles of money at casinos. In fact, it's become something of a stereotype in the sports world. But that doesn't make it any less embarrassing when it happens.

The Hawks are currently in last place in the Eastern Conference and could use some financial stability. This casino visit is not going to help them get there.

The Atlanta Hawks took a taxi to Viejas Casino Wednesday night. The Hawks had a team dinner at Seasons 52 in the UTC area and then took a taxi to the casino.

No one on the Hawks organization is talking about why they took the taxi to the casino, but it's clear that they were looking for some fun after a disappointing loss to the Utah Jazz.

"We had a team dinner and then we decided to take a taxi over to the casino," said Kent Bazemore. "It was a lot of fun. We had a great time."

The Hawks are in the midst of a tough stretch in their schedule, and it's clear that they were looking for some fun distractions. They'll need to get back to work on Thursday as they prepare for their game against the Los Angeles Lakers.
