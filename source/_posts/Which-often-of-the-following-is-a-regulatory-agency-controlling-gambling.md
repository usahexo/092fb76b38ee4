#  Gambling industry growth outpacing GDP

The gambling market is growing at a much faster rate than global GDP, led by Macau and Singapore, according to a new report from GlobalData.

The gambling market’s value is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.7% between 2017 and 2022, reaching $533.8 billion by the end of the period. The global GDP is meanwhile expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.5% during the same period, reaching $85.3 trillion in 2022.

This rapid growth is being driven by the expansion of gambling markets in Macau and Singapore, which are among the world’s most lucrative gaming destinations. The two countries accounted for more than half of the global gambling market in 2017.

Tom Selzam, Oil & Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “Macau and Singapore are leading the way in terms of overall gambling revenue, but there is also strong growth potential in other countries such as Japan and South Korea. These countries have well-developed casino industries and rising income levels that are encouraging more people to gamble.”

In terms of regional distribution, Asia Pacific is the dominant region for gambling, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total market value in 2017. This is due to the high penetration of casinos in countries such as Macau and Singapore, as well as strong economic growth prospects in countries such as China and India.

Tom Selzam added: “The Asia Pacific region is home to some of the world’s fastest-growing economies and this is driving demand for gambling products. In addition, rising incomes are helping to promote gambling uptake among consumers.”

#  Nevada online gambling bill signed into law

The Nevada online gambling bill has been signed into law by the state governor, Brian Sandoval. The new law legalizes online poker and casino games in the state, but it will not go into effect until January 1, 2013.

Governor Sandoval said that the new law "creates jobs and generates revenue for our schools and critical services". He also thanked the team of lawmakers who helped to get the bill passed in the state legislature.

Nevada is now the fourth US state to legalize online poker, after Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada. It is anticipated that more US states will legalize online gambling in the near future, as lawmakers seek to tap into the estimated $6 billion a year industry.

The passage of the Nevada online gambling bill is good news for Las Vegas casinos, which have seen declining revenues in recent years. With legalized online poker and casino games, they can now compete with gaming operators in other states who have been offering such services for years.

The new law prohibits anyone under 21 from playing poker or casino games online, and requires players to be physically located within Nevada's borders in order to participate. This should help to prevent rampant cheating and gaming abuses that have been seen in some other countries where online gambling is legal.

#  Delaware gambling regulator to award 5 online licenses

The Delaware gambling regulator is set to award five online licenses on Wednesday, as the state looks to broaden its gambling options.

The licenses will be for sports betting, table games, slots and poker. Operators must submit an application and pay a $10,000 fee.

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling in 2013, with three licenses awarded. However, the market has failed to takeoff due to a lack of competition.

This time around the regulator is hoping that by awarding five licenses it will attract more operators and revive the market.

One of the applicants is IGT (International Game Technology), which already operates an online poker room in Delaware.

Others include Dover Downs Hotel & Casino and Harrington Raceway & Casino.

#  Australian government to legalize online gambling

According to a report from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the country’s government is planning to legalize online gambling, in a bid to boost tax revenue.

The move – which is reportedly being championed by Treasurer Scott Morrison – would see the Australian Wagering and Gaming Act amended to allow wagers to be placed online.

It’s understood that this would not include poker, as concerns over match-fixing have forced the government to take a more cautious approach with that particular game. However, other types of gambling would be allowed, including sports betting, horse racing, and casino games.

The proposed changes are part of a wider agenda aimed at stimulating the country’s economy. This includes plans to cut taxes for small businesses and increase spending on infrastructure projects.

If approved, the new laws would come into effect from early 2019. They would represent a significant change for Australia, which is currently one of the last developed countries where online gambling is illegal.
