#  Eintracht Frankfurt Secures Playoff Spot with KC Victory

Eintracht Frankfurt secured their spot in the Bundesliga playoffs with a 2-1 victory over Sporting Kansas City on Wednesday night.

The win was not without controversy, as an apparent hand ball by Carlos Casimiro in the buildup to Eintracht's opening goal was not called by the referee.

Kingston Nyarko put Eintracht ahead in the 38th minute, and they held on for the win despite a late Sporting rally.

"I don't know what to say," said head coach Adi Hutter. "We deserved to win, but it was a very difficult game."

Eintracht will now face off against Union Berlin in a two-legged playoff to determine who will play in the Bundesliga next season.

#  Eintracht Frankfurt to Take on Hoffenheim in KC Battle

Eintracht Frankfurt's clash against Hoffenheim on Wednesday is likely to be a keenly contested affair, with both sides eager to take the three points.

With just two points separating the two teams in the Bundesliga table, a win for either side would be a big boost in their respective quests for European qualification.

Hoffenheim come into the game in good form, having won their last two matches against VfB Stuttgart and Fortuna Düsseldorf. By contrast, Frankfurt have lost two of their last three games.

However, with home advantage, Frankfurt will be confident of getting a positive result. The Eagles have only lost one of their last eight home games in all competitions.

For Hoffenheim, the main threat is likely to come from striker Andrej Kramaric, who has already scored 10 goals this season. Kramaric is ably supported by midfielder Florian Grillitsch and winger Pavel Kaderabek.

Frankfurt will need to keep a close eye on these players if they are to keep Hoffenheim at bay. central midfielder Makoto Hasebe will be key in denying them space and time on the ball.

In attack, it will be up to Luka Jovic and Sebastien Haller to provide the firepower for Frankfurt. Jovic has been in excellent form this season, scoring 11 goals in all competitions, while Haller has scored six goals since joining from Dutch side Utrecht in the summer.

Keller had one save for the visitors in the first half, but it was arguably his best effort of the match. In the 71st minute, Keller tipped a shot from close range by Dom Dwyer over the bar to keep Eintracht in front.

"I thought Timo played great tonight," Sporting KC coach Peter Vermes said. "He kept them in the game early on with some great saves."

Keller now has six shutouts on the season, tied for fourth most in MLS.

#  Eintracht Frankfurt Wins in a Thriller over KC

Eintracht Frankfurt needed a late winner to beat 10-man Sporting Kansas City 3-2 and keep their slim hopes of reaching the knockout stages of the CONCACAF Champions League alive.

After a goalless first half, Felipe Gutierrez gave Sporting KC the lead in the 52nd minute before Bruma equalized for Eintracht Frankfurt in the 72nd minute. Gianluca Dagostini was sent off for Sporting KC in the 83rd minute and substitute Luka Jovic scored the winner for Frankfurt in the 89th minute.

Sporting KC goalkeeper Tim Melia made a series of saves to keep his side in the game, but they were unable to hold on for a point and now have just one point from their first three games in Group F. Eintracht Frankfurt have two points from their first three games.

Eintracht Frankfurt looked like a well-oiled machine on Saturday night, cruising to a 5-0 victory over visiting Sporting Kansas City at Commerzbank-Arena.

The home side’s stunning start to the match saw Sebastian Rode and Luka Jovic both find the back of the net inside the opening 12 minutes, with the visitors looking shell-shocked.

Frankfurt continued their dominance in the second half, with Ante Rebic, Mijat Gacinovic and Makoto Hasebe all finding the back of the net to seal an emphatic win.

It was a perfect night for Frankfurt, who have now won five matches in a row in all competitions, and they sit just two points behind Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund.

For Sporting KC, it was a disappointing night as they failed to register a single shot on target and remain in sixth place in the Western Conference.
