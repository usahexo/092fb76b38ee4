#  Sports Betting Picks Freeze In Brescia Amidst Match-Fixing Scandal!

On Tuesday, Italian police arrested the captain of Italian second-division club Brescia, Fabio Egizi, and three other players on suspicion of match-fixing. This all comes just days after a Serie A game was called off due to suspicions of illegal betting.

Brescia is currently in first place in Serie B and officials fear that the arrests could jeopardize their promotion chances. In total, 11 people were arrested in connection with this latest match-fixing scandal, which spans from the lower leagues up to Serie A.

This is just the latest in a long line of match-fixing scandals that have rocked Italian football in recent years. In fact, this is actually the third time that Egizi has been arrested for match-fixing. In 2010, he was convicted for his role in fixing games while playing for Lecce and received a five-year ban from football.

The most high-profile case of match-fixing in Italian football came in 2006 when Juventus were stripped of their 2005/06 Serie A title and relegated to Serie B after being found guilty of fixing matches. The club’s president at the time, Luciano Moggi, was also banned from football for life.

Match-fixing is a serious problem worldwide and there have been numerous cases in other countries as well. Earlier this year, an investigation by UEFA led to 14 people being charged with fixing matches in the Turkish top flight. In 2017, four people were sentenced to prison terms for their role in fixing games in Australia’s second division.

Match-fixing can take many different forms but often occurs when players or officials are bribed to fix a game or manipulate the score. There are many reasons why someone might want to fix a game, such as gambling or financial gain, but it can also be done to help another team or player win unfairly.

Match-fixing can be very difficult to detect and often goes undetected until long after the game has been played. This is because there are usually no obvious signs that a game has been fixed and it can be difficult to determine whether or not a particular result is legitimate or not. As a result, it is often up to investigators to piece together evidence from many different sources in order to build a case against those suspected of involvement in match-fixing.

Despite the best efforts of investigators, however, it is often difficult to prove that a game has been fixed without catching someone red handed. As a result, many instances of match-fixing go unpunished and those responsible get away with their crimes scot free. This only serves to encourage more people to engage in this type of criminal activity and makes it increasingly difficult for authorities to crack down on it.

It remains to be seen what will happen with Brescia following the arrests of their captain and players but it is sure to have an impact on their season regardless. It is also likely that this latest scandal will have wider implications for Italian football as a whole and could lead to further investigations and prosecutions down the line.

#  Italian Sports Betting Picks Frozen Following Brescia Match-Fixing Revelations!

The latest news in the betting scandal rocking Italian football is that all bets on the Brescia v Cremonese match have now been frozen. This came about after Brescia President Massimo Cellino sensationally revealed that he had been offered money to fix the result of the game.

This announcement has rocked Italian football and has left many fans and pundits stunned. It is just another damning indictment of an sport that seems to be beset by corruption and scandal.

The news comes after a number of other high-profile incidents in recent years, including the Calciopoli match-fixing affair in 2006 and the betting scandal of 2011. This latest debacle will do nothing to restore faith in Italian football amongst fans or neutrals around the world.

One major concern is that this could be just the tip of the iceberg, and that there could be other games which have also been fixed. This would be a nightmare scenario for Italian football, as it would damage the image of the sport even further.

It is clear that a lot more needs to be done to clean up Italian football, and ensure that something like this does not happen again. There need to be greater transparency and accountability within the game, so that fans can have faith that it is being run fairly.

At present, it seems like there are too many people with vested interests who are able to manipulate games for their own gain. This needs to change if Italian football is to regain its reputation as one of the best leagues in world football.

#  Match-Fixing Forces Brescia Sportingbetting Picks To Freeze 

Italian football club Brescia's sportingbetting picks came to a standstill this week, following reports of match-fixing in the lower leagues. The team, which is currently sitting in first place in Serie C, has denied any wrongdoing and pledged to clear its name. However, Sportingbetting still refuses to release betting odds for any of the club's upcoming fixtures.

Brescia is one of several clubs being investigated by authorities for their involvement in a match-fixing scheme that has so far implicated over 100 people, including referees, players, and club officials. The discovery of the scam was made after an extensive wiretapping operation by police.

Investigators say that they have evidence that games were rigged across all three divisions of Italian football, with the aim of distorting betting odds. In some cases, matches were deliberately lost in order to benefit criminal gangs who had placed bets on the outcomes.

The scandal has rocked Italian football and led to the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including the president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). It is also likely to lead to drastic changes in how the sport is policed and regulated.

For Brescia, the fallout from the match-fixing scandal could not have come at a worse time. The team is vying for promotion to Serie A and its current position in first place would give it a good chance of achieving that goal. However, if Sportingbetting continues to refuse to offer betting odds for its games, then that could put a hitch in its plans.

Brescia isn't the only club affected by the scandal. At least two other teams involved in the alleged fix - Bari and Venezia - have had their matches postponed pending further investigations.

#  Sportingbetting's Picks For The Next Brescia Game Frozen After Officials Are Arrested 

On October 2, Italian officials arrested a dozen people suspected of being involved in rigging Serie B games. This has caused a ripple effect throughout the league, with one game already cancelled and another postponed.

One of the teams involved in this scandal is Brescia, who were scheduled to play Avellino on October 6. That match has now been frozen, pending the outcome of the investigations.

Brescia are currently in last place in Serie B, so it's likely that the game would have been a very one-sided affair. Sportingbetting still has odds for the match, but they will not be updated until the situation is resolved.

In the meantime, Sportingbetting is recommending bets on other games in Serie B. Here are their picks for this weekend:

Parma vs Cittadella - Parma are at home and have been playing well lately. They should be able to take down Cittadella fairly easily. Odds: 1.50

Ternana vs Novara - Ternana are another team who are doing well at home. They should be able to beat Novara with ease. Odds: 1.50

Padova vs Spezia - This should be a much closer match, with both teams having a good chance of winning. Padova are slight favourites, but it's worth considering a bet on Spezia as well. Odds: 2.60

#  Sportingbetting Halts All Brescia Picks Following Match-Fixing Scandal

Sportingbetting has announced that it is no longer taking bets on any matches involving Brescia following revelations of a widespread match-fixing scandal.

Italian authorities have arrested and charged more than 40 people in relation to the match-fixing, which is said to have taken place over a period of several years.

Brescia are one of the clubs involved in the scandal, and Sportingbetting has decided to halt all betting on their matches as a result.

It is not yet clear whether any other clubs will be implicated in the scandal, but Sportingbetting has said that it will continue to monitor the situation closely.

The news comes as a major blow to Brescia, who were hoping to make a return to Serie A this season.

They are currently second from bottom in Serie B, with only three wins from their first 15 games.
