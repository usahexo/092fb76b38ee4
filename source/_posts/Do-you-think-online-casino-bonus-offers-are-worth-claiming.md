#  Do you think online casino bonus offers are worth claiming?

There’s no doubt that online casino bonuses are attractive. Who wouldn’t want to claim free money or extra spins just for signing up? But, are these bonuses really worth claiming?

In most cases, the answer is no. The majority of online casino bonuses are riddled with conditions that make it very difficult to actually withdraw any winnings. In fact, in many cases you’ll have to wager your bonus a ridiculous amount of times before you can even think about cashing out.

For example, a casino may require you to wager your bonus and deposit amount 30 times before you can withdraw any winnings. That means you would have to wager $3,000 before you could withdraw a single cent!

There are a few exceptions of course. Some casinos offer bonuses with much more reasonable wagering requirements, and there are also some no-strings-attached welcome bonuses out there. But, in general, it’s not worth claiming an online casino bonus unless you know for sure that the requirements are reasonable.

#  What is your favourite online casino for bonuses?

There are many great online casinos for bonuses available, but my personal favourite is . It offers a huge range of bonuses and promotional offers, as well as a great selection of games.

#  Why do you think certain casinos offer free money bonuses?

 Casinos that offer free money bonuses do so in order to entice new players to sign up and gamble at their casino. These casinos hope that by offering a free bonus, the player will be more likely to gamble and eventually lose money. This is a common marketing tactic used by many online casinos.

#  Who is your favourite hockey goalkeeper – Dominik Hasek or Jaroslav Halák?

Dominik Hasek is the best goaltender to ever play in the NHL and it’s not even close. He was an amazing goalie during his time in the NHL and he’s still considered to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

Jaroslav Halák is a good goalie, but Dominik Hasek is a legend and there’s no comparison between the two. Halák has never won a Vezina Trophy, whereas Hasek has won six of them. Halák has also never won a Stanley Cup, whereas Hasek has won two of them.

Hockey fans might have different opinions on this topic, but there’s no doubt that Dominik Hasek is the best goalie to ever play in the NHL. He’s a true legend and he deserves to be remembered as such.
