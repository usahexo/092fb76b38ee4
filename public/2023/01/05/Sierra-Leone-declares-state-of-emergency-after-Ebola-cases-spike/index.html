The declaration came into effect on Wednesday and will last for 90 days.</p>
<p>“The Ebola virus disease continues to spread unabated in some parts of the country,” President Ernest Bai Koroma said in a statement. “I hereby declare a State of Public Emergency to enable us take very decisive actions both at national and regional levels to stop the spread of the disease.”</p>
<p>The President said that all Ebola suspects must now be immediately reported to the nearest health centre and that security forces would be deployed to help enforce port closures and prevent people from travelling illegally. He also said that all schools would be closed indefinitely.</p>
<p>This is the second time that a state of emergency has been declared in Sierra Leone over Ebola. The first declaration was made in March and lasted for three months.</p>
<h1 id="Sierra-Leone-opens-new-Ebola-treatment-center"><a href="#Sierra-Leone-opens-new-Ebola-treatment-center" class="headerlink" title="Sierra Leone opens new Ebola treatment center"></a>Sierra Leone opens new Ebola treatment center</h1><p>Sierra Leone’s new Ebola treatment center opened on Saturday, withPresident Ernest Bai Koroma in attendance. The $6.5 millionECDC-funded center has capacity for 120 patients and will serve as apilot for a larger, $22 million project that is scheduled to open inFreetown by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“The opening of this new Ebola Treatment Center is another steptowards defeating this epidemic,” President Koroma said.</p>
<p>TheEbola epidemic has killed more than 11,000 people and infected nearly 28,000since it began in Sierra Leone in 2014.</p>
<h1 id="Ebola-cases-in-Sierra-Leone-rising-faster-than-anywhere-else"><a href="#Ebola-cases-in-Sierra-Leone-rising-faster-than-anywhere-else" class="headerlink" title="Ebola cases in Sierra Leone rising faster than anywhere else"></a>Ebola cases in Sierra Leone rising faster than anywhere else</h1><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported that cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone are rising faster than anywhere else in the world. The number of new cases in Sierra Leone has almost doubled over the past three weeks, and there have been 881 deaths from the virus in the country so far.</p>
<p>In response to the growing crisis, Sierra Leone’s president, Ernest Bai Koroma, has declared a national emergency and called for help from the international community. The president also announced a series of measures to try to halt the spread of the virus, including the establishment of a “national contact tracing team” and the deployment of troops to areas where Ebola is most prevalent.</p>
<p>So far, there have been nearly 12,000 confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone, making it one of the countries worst affected by the disease. The majority of cases have been in the western region of the country, which is close to Guinea, where the outbreak began.</p>
<p>The government and people of Sierra Leone are desperately trying to contain the spread of Ebola and save as many lives as possible. However, they need more help from the international community in order to be successful. The WHO has warned that if action is not taken soon, there could be hundreds of thousands of cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone by early next year.</p>
<h1 id="Sierra-Leone-shuts-schools-in-bid-to-curb-Ebola-spread"><a href="#Sierra-Leone-shuts-schools-in-bid-to-curb-Ebola-spread" class="headerlink" title="Sierra Leone shuts schools in bid to curb Ebola spread"></a>Sierra Leone shuts schools in bid to curb Ebola spread</h1><p>Freetown, Sierra Leone - The Sierra Leone government has closed all schools in an effort to stop the spread of the Ebola virus, which has killed more than 1,000 people in West Africa this year.</p>
<p>The order from the Ministry of Education affects more than 2 million students and came into effect on Monday. It follows closures last week of cinemas, nightclubs and other public places.</p>
<p>Most of the Ebola cases have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The World Health Organisation says there have been more than 3,400 suspected or confirmed cases, with about 1,500 deaths.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone’s President Ernest Bai Koroma says the “drastic action” is needed to save lives.</p>
<h1 id="Sierra-Leone-on-the-brink-of-an-Ebola-pandemic"><a href="#Sierra-Leone-on-the-brink-of-an-Ebola-pandemic" class="headerlink" title="Sierra Leone on the brink of an Ebola pandemic?"></a>Sierra Leone on the brink of an Ebola pandemic?</h1><p>The Ebola Outbreak of 2014 has unfolded into the world’s largest-ever epidemic of the deadly virus. With over 25,000 cases and 11,000 dead so far, Sierra Leone is one of the worst-affected countries.</p>
<p>In March 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Ebola to be a global public health emergency. The move was sparked by an upsurge in cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with fears that the outbreak could spread to other countries.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone is on high alert for an Ebola pandemic, with health officials working tirelessly to contain the outbreak. However, there are many challenges in preventing and controlling the spread of Ebola, including limited resources and a lack of awareness among the population.</p>
<p>This article will explore the history of Ebola in Sierra Leone, describe the current situation and discuss the challenges faced by health officials in preventing an outbreak.</p>
<h3 id="The-History-of-Ebola-in-Sierra-Leone"><a href="#The-History-of-Ebola-in-Sierra-Leone" class="headerlink" title="The History of Ebola in Sierra Leone"></a>The History of Ebola in Sierra Leone</h3><p>The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now known as DRC. In subsequent years, outbreaks of Ebola occurred sporadically in Africa. In most cases, these outbreaks were contained within a few months.</p>
<p>However, in 2014 a large-scale outbreak erupted in West Africa, affecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. This was the first time that Ebola had been detected in this region of Africa and it soon spread out of control. By October 2014 there were over 10,000 confirmed cases and almost 5,000 fatalities.</p>
<p>Since then, Sierra Leone has been one of the worst-affected countries in terms of both cases and fatalities. As of March 2019 there have been over 24,600 confirmed cases and over 11,000 deaths. The majority of these cases have occurred in three districts: Port Loko (5,815), Bombali (4,202) and Kambia district (3242). These districts are all located close to Sierra Leone’s borders with Guinea and Liberia - two other countries affected by the epidemic.</p>
<h3 id="The-Current-Situation"><a href="#The-Current-Situation" class="headerlink" title="The Current Situation"></a>The Current Situation</h3><p>Ebola is a highly contagious virus which can cause severe fever, muscle pain, headache and vomiting. In some cases it can lead to organ failure and death. There is no cure or specific treatment for Ebola patients and they must receive intensive supportive care if they are to survive.</p>
<p>The current outbreak of Ebola is taking place in DRC where there have been over 2200 confirmed cases since August 2018 - making it Africa’s second-largest outbreak after Sierra Leone’s 2014 epidemic. More than 1,500 people have died from this latest outbreak so far. There are also fears that the virus could spread to other countries due to its proximity to Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan - all countries with weak health systems.</p>
<pre><code> In March 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Ebola to be a global public health emergency due to its potential to cause a pandemic . This declaration was made following an upsurge in cases in DRC , with fears that the outbreak could spread to other countries .

 As part of its response to this global health emergency , WHO has released $100 million for emergency operations in DRC . This money will be used for supplies such as medical kits , protective equipment , training for healthcare workers and coordinating response activities .

 The risk of an Ebola pandemic is high given that the virus has already crossed borders into several neighbouring countries . In addition , WHO has warned that there is a very high risk that new clusters will appear in other areas with high levels of insecurity and poor access to health services .

<p>  What can be done to prevent an Ebola pandemic?</p>
<p>There are many challenges involved in preventing an outbreak of Ebola from becoming a full-blown pandemic . Some key challenges include:</p>
