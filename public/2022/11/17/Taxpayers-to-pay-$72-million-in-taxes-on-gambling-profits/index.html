        <h1 id="Taxpayers-to-pay-72-million-in-taxes-on-gambling-profits"><a href="#Taxpayers-to-pay-72-million-in-taxes-on-gambling-profits" class="headerlink" title="Taxpayers to pay $72 million in taxes on gambling profits"></a>Taxpayers to pay $72 million in taxes on gambling profits</h1><p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has released new figures that show taxpayers will have to fork out $72 million in taxes on gambling profits in the next financial year.</p>
<p>This is a 4.5% increase on the $68.7 million paid in tax in the previous year, and highlights the growing popularity of gambling in Australia.</p>
<p>The ATO said that around two-thirds of the money raised from gambling taxes will go towards funding community services, with the remaining one-third being used to fund sports and racing organisations.</p>
<p>“These figures demonstrate the importance of regulating gambling activities and ensuring that taxes are paid on any profits generated,” an ATO spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“Gambling taxes go towards important community services, such as problem gambling counselling, mental health services and drug and alcohol treatment programs.”</p>
<p>The news comes as the Australian Labor Party announced it would be increasing taxes on gambling if it was elected to government at next month’s federal election.</p>
<p>Under Labor’s proposed changes, taxes on poker machines would be increased by 10%, while taxes on other forms of gambling would be increased by 25%.</p>
<p>The move is estimated to raise an extra $300 million per year which would be used to fund public schools and hospitals.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-companies-expected-to-pay-6-3-billion-in-taxes"><a href="#Gaming-companies-expected-to-pay-6-3-billion-in-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Gaming companies expected to pay $6.3 billion in taxes"></a>Gaming companies expected to pay $6.3 billion in taxes</h1><p>Gaming companies are making a fortune, and the government wants its share.</p>
<p>A new report from France’s Gaming Commission has stated that the country’s gaming companies are expected to pay €5.5 billion (or $6.3 billion) in taxes this year. That figure marks a 9% increase from last year, and it’s no surprise, given the amount of money that gaming companies are raking in.</p>
<p>Just last month, for example, NetEnt announced that it had pulled in a record profit of €746 million for 2018. Similarly, Microgaming said its profits had climbed by 29% over the same period, reaching £141 million. And those are just two examples – it’s clear that the gaming industry is doing very well indeed.</p>
<p>What is perhaps more surprising is that France’s government is only now starting to collect taxes from these companies. The Gaming Commission report notes that “online games are taxed since January 1st, 2019 following their commercial exploitation in France, through an agreement reached between the State and the sector representatives during the autumn of 2018.”</p>
<p>In other words, it’s taken until now for the French government to get around to imposing taxes on online gaming companies; but with profits continuing to grow at such a rapid rate, it’s no wonder they felt compelled to act.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not all of the tax revenue will go towards the government’s coffers; some of it will be set aside for gambling addiction prevention and treatment programmes. That should come as good news to those who have been calling for better protection for players – after all, with so much money at stake, it’s important that those who fall victim to gambling addiction don’t end up losing everything they own.</p>
<p>So far, it looks like France is the only country in Europe that has started taxing online gaming companies; but with profits continuing to grow elsewhere too, it seems likely that other governments will soon follow suit. In fact, Spain has already hinted that it might begin collecting taxes from gaming firms in 2020; and with revenues reaching as high as €24 billion across Europe, there’s plenty of potential tax revenue to be had.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-companies-brace-for-new-tax-bill"><a href="#Gambling-companies-brace-for-new-tax-bill" class="headerlink" title="Gambling companies brace for new tax bill"></a>Gambling companies brace for new tax bill</h1><p>Gambling companies are bracing for a new bill that would impose a tax on their profits, according to industry sources.</p>
<p>The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), would levy a 10 percent tax on the gross receipts of casinos and other gambling businesses. The measure would raise an estimated $8 billion over 10 years, according to congressional analysts.</p>
<p>Waters said the bill is needed to help pay for Democrats’ sweeping new agenda, which includes expanding health care and creating a new government-run retirement program.</p>
<p>“This legislation will provide much-needed revenue to invest in Democratic priorities like health care and retirement security while closing a major corporate tax loophole,” Waters said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bill is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled Congress, but it could serve as a starting point for negotiations over a broader tax overhaul package. Gambling companies are pushing back against the proposal, warning that it could lead to job losses and closures of casinos and other businesses.</p>
<p>“This is nothing more than another political ploy by Ms. Waters to raise taxes on an industry that she doesn’t like,” said Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association. “It will cost jobs and lead to less investment in our communities.”</p>
<h1 id="How-the-new-gambling-taxes-will-impact-casinos"><a href="#How-the-new-gambling-taxes-will-impact-casinos" class="headerlink" title="How the new gambling taxes will impact casinos"></a>How the new gambling taxes will impact casinos</h1><p>The government has announced plans to increase taxes on gambling, in a bid to raise an extra £500 million per year. The new taxes will impact casinos, bookmakers and online gambling companies, and are expected to come into effect from April 2020.</p>
<p>The changes will see the amount of tax payable on gaming machines increased from 25% to 35%. The tax on profits from B2 gaming (betting with a bookmaker) will also be increased from 15% to 20%. And finally, the tax on profits from remote gaming (online gambling) will be increased from 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>The government says that the extra money raised will be used to fund public services such as education and health. But the casinos and betting firms say that the increases will lead to job losses and closures, particularly in deprived areas.</p>
<p>The gambling industry is worth an estimated £13.5 billion per year, so the new taxes are expected to raise around £675 million per year. This is less than the government was hoping for – they were aiming for £1 billion per year – but it’s still a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>The increases come at a time when the gambling industry is under pressure, due to increasing competition from online casinos and the rise of ‘social casino games’ such as Farmville and Candy Crush. This has led to a decline in profits for traditional casinos and betting firms.</p>
<p>So far, only one casino has said that it plans to close in response to the increases in taxes. Coral Betting has announced that it will close all of its shops in Wales due to the new taxes. But other firms are expected to follow suit, as they struggle to cope with the increased costs.</p>
<p>Job losses are also likely, as firms seek ways to reduce their costs. It’s estimated that around 10,000 jobs could go in the next few years as a result of the new taxes.</p>
<p>Casinos and betting firms have warned that the new taxes could lead to a black market in betting, as people seek ways to avoid paying the increased rates. This would be bad news for both consumers and taxpayers, as it would lead to an increase in crime and lost revenues for the government.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s clear that the new gambling taxes will have a significant impact on casinos and betting firms. They’ll need to find ways to reduce their costs if they want to survive in a competitive market place. And while it’s too early to know what this will mean for jobs and closures, it seems likely that we’ll see some negative consequences over the next few years.</p>

<p>If approved, the new tax could bring in millions of dollars for local schools.</p>
<p>Ohio has a history of supporting gambling, with casinos and racetracks dotting the landscape.</p>
<p>But lawmakers have been reluctant to institute a gambling tax in the past, out of fear that it would drive business elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now, with state coffers running low, officials are reconsidering the idea.</p>
<p>A study commissioned by the state found that a 10 percent tax on gambling revenues could bring in as much as $265 million per year.</p>
<p>That money could be used to help fund education and other essential services in the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of the gambling tax say it would be a win-win for Ohioans.</p>
<p>They argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for schools while also creating jobs and boosting the economy.</p>
