        <h1 id="What-if-the-Eagles-and-Saints-both-lose-on-Sunday"><a href="#What-if-the-Eagles-and-Saints-both-lose-on-Sunday" class="headerlink" title="What if the Eagles and Saints both lose on Sunday?"></a>What if the Eagles and Saints both lose on Sunday?</h1><p>It’s a question that NFL fans have been asking all week long in the lead-up to the final weekend of the season. If both the Eagles and Saints lose on Sunday, which team would claim the No. 1 seed in the NFC?</p>
<p>The Eagles currently hold the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a 13-2 record. The Saints are right behind them with a 12-3 record. If both Philadelphia and New Orleans lose this weekend, the Saints would take over the top spot based on their head-to-head record against the Eagles (the Eagles won their first matchup, but lost their second).</p>
<p>That said, there are a few other scenarios that could play out on Sunday. If both Philly and NO win, but one of them has less than 14 points, then Minnesota would claim the No. 1 seed over New Orleans due to their conference record (Minnesota is 11-3 in the NFC while New Orleans is 10-4). If both Philly and NO lose by at least 14 points, then LA would take over as the top seed in the NFC.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are a lot of different ways things could shake out on Sunday. The important thing for NFL fans is to pay close attention to all of the games and see what happens. The final standings in the NFC could be determined by just one or two games on Sunday afternoon!</p>
<h1 id="3-teams-still-in-the-hunt-for-the-NFC-wild-card"><a href="#3-teams-still-in-the-hunt-for-the-NFC-wild-card" class="headerlink" title="3 teams still in the hunt for the NFC wild card"></a>3 teams still in the hunt for the NFC wild card</h1><p>The NFL season is winding down, and with just a few weeks left, the playoff picture is starting to take shape. In the NFC, there are currently three teams vying for the two remaining wild card spots.</p>
<p>The first team in contention is the Atlanta Falcons. They currently have a record of 7-5, which puts them in second place in the NFC South. The Falcons have been inconsistent this season, but they still have a chance to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>The second team in contention is the Seattle Seahawks. They are currently 6-6 and sit in third place in the NFC West. The Seahawks have been up and down this season, but they still have a chance to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>The final team in contention is the Detroit Lions. They are also 6-6, but they are in last place in the NFC North. The Lions have not been very good this season, but they still have a chance to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>All three of these teams will need to finish strong if they want to make it to the playoffs. The Falcons and Seahawks both play division rivals in their final two games, while the Lions play two AFC North teams. If any of these teams can win out, they will likely clinch a playoff berth.</p>
<h1 id="Is-this-the-end-of-the-road-for-Carolina"><a href="#Is-this-the-end-of-the-road-for-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Is this the end of the road for Carolina?"></a>Is this the end of the road for Carolina?</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers have had a rough season. They currently sit at 3-8, which is good for last place in the NFC South. Things don’t look like they are going to get much better in the near future either.</p>
<p>Carolina will be without starting quarterback Cam Newton for the next few weeks due to a shoulder injury. Backup quarterback Taylor Heinicke is also out with a foot injury. This means that rookie third-string quarterback Kyle Allen will be starting for the Panthers in their upcoming game against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<p>The Seahawks are a very tough opponent, and it’s not looking good for Carolina. If they lose this game, it’s likely that they will be eliminated from playoff contention.</p>
<p>This would be yet another disappointing season for the Panthers. They made it to the Super Bowl two years ago, but have since failed to make the playoffs. Now it seems as though they may be headed for another losing season.</p>
<p>There could be some major changes coming in Carolina after this season. Head coach Ron Rivera may be fired, and there could also be changes on the roster. Wide receiver Devin Funchess is likely to leave as a free agent, and there are rumors that linebacker Luke Kuechly may retire.</p>
<p>All of this uncertainty makes it difficult to know what the future holds for the Panthers. One thing is for sure though: It doesn’t look good right now.</p>
<h1 id="Giants-facing-must-win-situation-against-Bengals"><a href="#Giants-facing-must-win-situation-against-Bengals" class="headerlink" title="Giants facing must-win situation against Bengals"></a>Giants facing must-win situation against Bengals</h1><p>The New York Giants will take on the Cincinnati Bengals this week in what has been deemed a “must-win” situation.</p>
<p>Coming into the game at 1-5, the Giants realize that they likely won’t be making the playoffs this season. With that in mind, they’ll need to win out in order to have any chance at salvaging their campaign.</p>
<p>The Bengals, on the other hand, are coming off of a big win over the Miami Dolphins and will be looking to keep their momentum going.</p>
<p>For the Giants to come away with a victory, they’ll need to play mistake-free football and limit Cincinnati’s scoring opportunities. In addition, they’ll need to get a strong performance from quarterback Eli Manning and their running backs.</p>
<p>If they can do all of that, then they’ll have a good chance of picking up their second win of the year.</p>
<h1 id="Vikings-looking-to-stay-in-playoff-race-against-Falcons"><a href="#Vikings-looking-to-stay-in-playoff-race-against-Falcons" class="headerlink" title="Vikings looking to stay in playoff race against Falcons"></a>Vikings looking to stay in playoff race against Falcons</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings will look to keep their playoff hopes alive when they take on the Atlanta Falcons in a key NFC matchup. The Vikings (6-5-1) come into the game having won two straight games, while the Falcons (4-8) have lost three of their last four contests.</p>
<p>Minnesota has been led offensively by quarterback Kirk Cousins, who is averaging nearly 310 passing yards per game. He has also thrown for 24 touchdowns this season. Wide receiver Adam Thielen is Cousins’ favorite target, and he leads the team in both receptions (92) and receiving yards (1,274).</p>
<p>The Falcons have been struggling offensively in recent weeks, averaging just over 16 points per game over their last four contests. Quarterback Matt Ryan has been the team’s leading passer, but he has been hobbled by ankle and rib injuries in recent weeks. Top receivers Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu have also missed time with injuries.</p>
<p>In order to win on Sunday, the Vikings will need to contain Ryan and the Falcons’ offense. They will also need to get a big performance from running back Dalvin Cook, who is coming off of his best game of the season.</p>
<p>The Falcons will need to get pressure on Cousins and force him into some mistakes. They will also need to get a big game from Ryan, Jones and Sanu if they hope to pull off the upset victory.</p>
