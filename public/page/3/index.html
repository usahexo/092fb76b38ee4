<li>The Federal Trade Commission</li>
</ol>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission is a regulatory agency controlling gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-industry-growth-outpacing-GDP"><a href="#Gambling-industry-growth-outpacing-GDP" class="headerlink" title="Gambling industry growth outpacing GDP"></a>Gambling industry growth outpacing GDP</h1><p>The gambling market is growing at a much faster rate than global GDP, led by Macau and Singapore, according to a new report from GlobalData.</p>
<p>The gambling market’s value is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.7% between 2017 and 2022, reaching $533.8 billion by the end of the period. The global GDP is meanwhile expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.5% during the same period, reaching $85.3 trillion in 2022.</p>
<p>This rapid growth is being driven by the expansion of gambling markets in Macau and Singapore, which are among the world’s most lucrative gaming destinations. The two countries accounted for more than half of the global gambling market in 2017.</p>
<p>Tom Selzam, Oil &amp; Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “Macau and Singapore are leading the way in terms of overall gambling revenue, but there is also strong growth potential in other countries such as Japan and South Korea. These countries have well-developed casino industries and rising income levels that are encouraging more people to gamble.”</p>
<p>In terms of regional distribution, Asia Pacific is the dominant region for gambling, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total market value in 2017. This is due to the high penetration of casinos in countries such as Macau and Singapore, as well as strong economic growth prospects in countries such as China and India.</p>
<p>Tom Selzam added: “The Asia Pacific region is home to some of the world’s fastest-growing economies and this is driving demand for gambling products. In addition, rising incomes are helping to promote gambling uptake among consumers.”</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-online-gambling-bill-signed-into-law"><a href="#Nevada-online-gambling-bill-signed-into-law" class="headerlink" title="Nevada online gambling bill signed into law"></a>Nevada online gambling bill signed into law</h1><p>The Nevada online gambling bill has been signed into law by the state governor, Brian Sandoval. The new law legalizes online poker and casino games in the state, but it will not go into effect until January 1, 2013.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval said that the new law “creates jobs and generates revenue for our schools and critical services”. He also thanked the team of lawmakers who helped to get the bill passed in the state legislature.</p>
<p>Nevada is now the fourth US state to legalize online poker, after Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada. It is anticipated that more US states will legalize online gambling in the near future, as lawmakers seek to tap into the estimated $6 billion a year industry.</p>
<p>The passage of the Nevada online gambling bill is good news for Las Vegas casinos, which have seen declining revenues in recent years. With legalized online poker and casino games, they can now compete with gaming operators in other states who have been offering such services for years.</p>
<p>The new law prohibits anyone under 21 from playing poker or casino games online, and requires players to be physically located within Nevada’s borders in order to participate. This should help to prevent rampant cheating and gaming abuses that have been seen in some other countries where online gambling is legal.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-gambling-regulator-to-award-5-online-licenses"><a href="#Delaware-gambling-regulator-to-award-5-online-licenses" class="headerlink" title="Delaware gambling regulator to award 5 online licenses"></a>Delaware gambling regulator to award 5 online licenses</h1><p>The Delaware gambling regulator is set to award five online licenses on Wednesday, as the state looks to broaden its gambling options.</p>
<p>The licenses will be for sports betting, table games, slots and poker. Operators must submit an application and pay a $10,000 fee.</p>
<p>Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling in 2013, with three licenses awarded. However, the market has failed to takeoff due to a lack of competition.</p>
<p>This time around the regulator is hoping that by awarding five licenses it will attract more operators and revive the market.</p>
<p>One of the applicants is IGT (International Game Technology), which already operates an online poker room in Delaware.</p>
<p>Others include Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino and Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino.</p>
<h1 id="Australian-government-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Australian-government-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Australian government to legalize online gambling"></a>Australian government to legalize online gambling</h1><p>According to a report from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the country’s government is planning to legalize online gambling, in a bid to boost tax revenue.</p>
<p>The move – which is reportedly being championed by Treasurer Scott Morrison – would see the Australian Wagering and Gaming Act amended to allow wagers to be placed online.</p>
<p>It’s understood that this would not include poker, as concerns over match-fixing have forced the government to take a more cautious approach with that particular game. However, other types of gambling would be allowed, including sports betting, horse racing, and casino games.</p>
<p>The proposed changes are part of a wider agenda aimed at stimulating the country’s economy. This includes plans to cut taxes for small businesses and increase spending on infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>If approved, the new laws would come into effect from early 2019. They would represent a significant change for Australia, which is currently one of the last developed countries where online gambling is illegal.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Taxpayers-to-pay-72-million-in-taxes-on-gambling-profits"><a href="#Taxpayers-to-pay-72-million-in-taxes-on-gambling-profits" class="headerlink" title="Taxpayers to pay $72 million in taxes on gambling profits"></a>Taxpayers to pay $72 million in taxes on gambling profits</h1><p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has released new figures that show taxpayers will have to fork out $72 million in taxes on gambling profits in the next financial year.</p>
<p>This is a 4.5% increase on the $68.7 million paid in tax in the previous year, and highlights the growing popularity of gambling in Australia.</p>
<p>The ATO said that around two-thirds of the money raised from gambling taxes will go towards funding community services, with the remaining one-third being used to fund sports and racing organisations.</p>
<p>“These figures demonstrate the importance of regulating gambling activities and ensuring that taxes are paid on any profits generated,” an ATO spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“Gambling taxes go towards important community services, such as problem gambling counselling, mental health services and drug and alcohol treatment programs.”</p>
<p>The news comes as the Australian Labor Party announced it would be increasing taxes on gambling if it was elected to government at next month’s federal election.</p>
<p>Under Labor’s proposed changes, taxes on poker machines would be increased by 10%, while taxes on other forms of gambling would be increased by 25%.</p>
<p>The move is estimated to raise an extra $300 million per year which would be used to fund public schools and hospitals.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-companies-expected-to-pay-6-3-billion-in-taxes"><a href="#Gaming-companies-expected-to-pay-6-3-billion-in-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Gaming companies expected to pay $6.3 billion in taxes"></a>Gaming companies expected to pay $6.3 billion in taxes</h1><p>Gaming companies are making a fortune, and the government wants its share.</p>
<p>A new report from France’s Gaming Commission has stated that the country’s gaming companies are expected to pay €5.5 billion (or $6.3 billion) in taxes this year. That figure marks a 9% increase from last year, and it’s no surprise, given the amount of money that gaming companies are raking in.</p>
<p>Just last month, for example, NetEnt announced that it had pulled in a record profit of €746 million for 2018. Similarly, Microgaming said its profits had climbed by 29% over the same period, reaching £141 million. And those are just two examples – it’s clear that the gaming industry is doing very well indeed.</p>
<p>What is perhaps more surprising is that France’s government is only now starting to collect taxes from these companies. The Gaming Commission report notes that “online games are taxed since January 1st, 2019 following their commercial exploitation in France, through an agreement reached between the State and the sector representatives during the autumn of 2018.”</p>
<p>In other words, it’s taken until now for the French government to get around to imposing taxes on online gaming companies; but with profits continuing to grow at such a rapid rate, it’s no wonder they felt compelled to act.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not all of the tax revenue will go towards the government’s coffers; some of it will be set aside for gambling addiction prevention and treatment programmes. That should come as good news to those who have been calling for better protection for players – after all, with so much money at stake, it’s important that those who fall victim to gambling addiction don’t end up losing everything they own.</p>
<p>So far, it looks like France is the only country in Europe that has started taxing online gaming companies; but with profits continuing to grow elsewhere too, it seems likely that other governments will soon follow suit. In fact, Spain has already hinted that it might begin collecting taxes from gaming firms in 2020; and with revenues reaching as high as €24 billion across Europe, there’s plenty of potential tax revenue to be had.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-companies-brace-for-new-tax-bill"><a href="#Gambling-companies-brace-for-new-tax-bill" class="headerlink" title="Gambling companies brace for new tax bill"></a>Gambling companies brace for new tax bill</h1><p>Gambling companies are bracing for a new bill that would impose a tax on their profits, according to industry sources.</p>
<p>The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), would levy a 10 percent tax on the gross receipts of casinos and other gambling businesses. The measure would raise an estimated $8 billion over 10 years, according to congressional analysts.</p>
<p>Waters said the bill is needed to help pay for Democrats’ sweeping new agenda, which includes expanding health care and creating a new government-run retirement program.</p>
<p>“This legislation will provide much-needed revenue to invest in Democratic priorities like health care and retirement security while closing a major corporate tax loophole,” Waters said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bill is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled Congress, but it could serve as a starting point for negotiations over a broader tax overhaul package. Gambling companies are pushing back against the proposal, warning that it could lead to job losses and closures of casinos and other businesses.</p>
<p>“This is nothing more than another political ploy by Ms. Waters to raise taxes on an industry that she doesn’t like,” said Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association. “It will cost jobs and lead to less investment in our communities.”</p>
<h1 id="How-the-new-gambling-taxes-will-impact-casinos"><a href="#How-the-new-gambling-taxes-will-impact-casinos" class="headerlink" title="How the new gambling taxes will impact casinos"></a>How the new gambling taxes will impact casinos</h1><p>The government has announced plans to increase taxes on gambling, in a bid to raise an extra £500 million per year. The new taxes will impact casinos, bookmakers and online gambling companies, and are expected to come into effect from April 2020.</p>
<p>The changes will see the amount of tax payable on gaming machines increased from 25% to 35%. The tax on profits from B2 gaming (betting with a bookmaker) will also be increased from 15% to 20%. And finally, the tax on profits from remote gaming (online gambling) will be increased from 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>The government says that the extra money raised will be used to fund public services such as education and health. But the casinos and betting firms say that the increases will lead to job losses and closures, particularly in deprived areas.</p>
<p>The gambling industry is worth an estimated £13.5 billion per year, so the new taxes are expected to raise around £675 million per year. This is less than the government was hoping for – they were aiming for £1 billion per year – but it’s still a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>The increases come at a time when the gambling industry is under pressure, due to increasing competition from online casinos and the rise of ‘social casino games’ such as Farmville and Candy Crush. This has led to a decline in profits for traditional casinos and betting firms.</p>
<p>So far, only one casino has said that it plans to close in response to the increases in taxes. Coral Betting has announced that it will close all of its shops in Wales due to the new taxes. But other firms are expected to follow suit, as they struggle to cope with the increased costs.</p>
<p>Job losses are also likely, as firms seek ways to reduce their costs. It’s estimated that around 10,000 jobs could go in the next few years as a result of the new taxes.</p>
<p>Casinos and betting firms have warned that the new taxes could lead to a black market in betting, as people seek ways to avoid paying the increased rates. This would be bad news for both consumers and taxpayers, as it would lead to an increase in crime and lost revenues for the government.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s clear that the new gambling taxes will have a significant impact on casinos and betting firms. They’ll need to find ways to reduce their costs if they want to survive in a competitive market place. And while it’s too early to know what this will mean for jobs and closures, it seems likely that we’ll see some negative consequences over the next few years.</p>
<h1 id="Proposed-gambling-tax-could-mean-big-bucks-for-Ohio-schools"><a href="#Proposed-gambling-tax-could-mean-big-bucks-for-Ohio-schools" class="headerlink" title="Proposed gambling tax could mean big bucks for Ohio schools"></a>Proposed gambling tax could mean big bucks for Ohio schools</h1><p>As the Ohio state government looks for new sources of revenue, some officials are eyeing a potential gambling tax.</p>
<p>If approved, the new tax could bring in millions of dollars for local schools.</p>
<p>Ohio has a history of supporting gambling, with casinos and racetracks dotting the landscape.</p>
<p>But lawmakers have been reluctant to institute a gambling tax in the past, out of fear that it would drive business elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now, with state coffers running low, officials are reconsidering the idea.</p>
<p>A study commissioned by the state found that a 10 percent tax on gambling revenues could bring in as much as $265 million per year.</p>
<p>That money could be used to help fund education and other essential services in the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of the gambling tax say it would be a win-win for Ohioans.</p>
<p>They argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for schools while also creating jobs and boosting the economy.</p>

        <h1 id="5-ways-to-beat-the-online-gambling-laws-in-your-state"><a href="#5-ways-to-beat-the-online-gambling-laws-in-your-state" class="headerlink" title="5 ways to beat the online gambling laws in your state"></a>5 ways to beat the online gambling laws in your state</h1><p>It’s no secret that online gambling is big business. In fact, a recent study by H2 Gambling Capital revealed that global online gambling revenue totaled $41.7 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow to $81.7 billion by 2021. irrespective of your feelings on the matter, the fact is that online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry and growing.</p>
<p>However, as with most things in life, there are rules and regulations governing online gambling – even if they can vary from state to state within the United States. So, if you’re an online gambler living in the US, it’s important to understand the laws regulating online gambling in your state so that you don’t run afoul of them.</p>
<p>In this article, we take a look at five ways to beat the online gambling laws in your state.</p>
<p>#1 Use a foreign VPN service</p>
<p>One way to get around the online gambling laws in your state is to use a foreign VPN service. By using a VPN service based outside of your state, you can conceal your true location and access online casinos and betting sites that would otherwise be blocked due to local regulations.</p>
<p>There are numerous VPN services available, both free and paid, so it’s important to do your research before settling on one. Be sure to select one that offers good customer support in case you run into any problems while using it.</p>
<p>#2 Use an offshore sportsbook or casino site</p>
<p>Another way to get around the online gambling laws in your state is to use an offshore sportsbook or casino site instead of those located within your jurisdiction. Offshore sportsbooks and casinos are not bound by the same regulations as those within your state, so they are often more lenient when it comes to accepting bets and players from all over the world.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that not all offshore sportsbooks and casinos are trustworthy or reputable. So before signing up with any such site, be sure to do your research first and read reviews from other players.</p>
<p>#3 Use a proxy or TOR network connection</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use a VPN service or an offshore sportsbook&#x2F;casino site, another option is to use a proxy or TOR network connection instead. A proxy server allows you to conceal your true IP address and surf the web anonymously, while a TOR network connection uses multiple computers around the world connected through volunteers’ servers in order to keep users anonymous (and protect their privacy).</p>
<p>Both of these options are free but can be more complicated than using a VPN service or offshore sportsbook&#x2F;casino site. So if you’re new to them, be sure to do some research beforehand so that you know how to use them effectively.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-gamble-online-and-stay-within-the-law"><a href="#How-to-gamble-online-and-stay-within-the-law" class="headerlink" title="How to gamble online and stay within the law"></a>How to gamble online and stay within the law</h1><p>It can be fun to gamble from time to time, but it’s important to do so legally. Here’s a guide on how to gamble online without breaking any laws.</p>
<h1 id="Find-a-reputable-site"><a href="#Find-a-reputable-site" class="headerlink" title="Find a reputable site"></a>Find a reputable site</h1><p>The first step is to find a reputable gambling site. There are many out there, but not all of them are legitimate. Make sure to do your research and only use sites that are licensed and regulated by a governing body.</p>
<h1 id="Check-the-age-requirements"><a href="#Check-the-age-requirements" class="headerlink" title="Check the age requirements"></a>Check the age requirements</h1><p>Another thing you’ll want to look at is the age requirements. Gambling sites typically require that you be at least 18 years old in order to gamble. If you’re not yet 18, you’ll need to wait until you are before signing up.</p>
<h1 id="Read-the-terms-and-conditions"><a href="#Read-the-terms-and-conditions" class="headerlink" title="Read the terms and conditions"></a>Read the terms and conditions</h1><p>Next, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the site before signing up. This will help ensure that you understand the rules and regulations of the site. It will also outline things like deposit and withdrawal limits, as well as any other important information.</p>
<h1 id="Always-play-responsibly"><a href="#Always-play-responsibly" class="headerlink" title="Always play responsibly"></a>Always play responsibly</h1><p>Finally, remember to play responsibly. Gambling should always be done for fun and never as a way to make money. If you find yourself losing too much money, it’s time to stop playing.</p>
<h1 id="Which-states-have-the-loosest-online-gambling-laws"><a href="#Which-states-have-the-loosest-online-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="Which states have the loosest online gambling laws?"></a>Which states have the loosest online gambling laws?</h1><p>Online gambling is a popular pastime for Americans, but it’s not always clear which states have the loosest laws around it. Some states have outlawed online gambling altogether, while others have specific laws that make it difficult to gamble online.</p>
<p>Here is a list of five states with the loosest online gambling laws:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nevada</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevada has always been a gambling-friendly state, and this includes online gambling. There are no specific laws regulating online gambling in Nevada, and no restrictions on who can gamble or where they can gamble. This makes Nevada a great place to gamble online, especially for residents of other states with stricter laws.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>New Jersey</li>
</ol>
<p>New Jersey also has very lax online gambling laws. There are no specific regulations governing online gambling in NJ, and no restrictions on who can gamble or where they can gamble. In fact, New Jersey was one of the first states to legalize and regulate online casinos in 2013. This makes it a great place to gamble online, especially for residents of other states with stricter laws.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Delaware</li>
</ol>
<p>Delaware also has very relaxed online gambling laws. There are no specific regulations governing online gambling in Delaware, and no restrictions on who can gamble or where they can gamble. In fact, Delaware was one of the first states to legalize and regulate online casinos in 2013. This makes it a great place to gamble online, especially for residents of other states with stricter laws.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Pennsylvania</li>
</ol>
<p>Pennsylvania has recently legalized online casinos and poker rooms, making it one of the most gambling-friendly states in the country. There are currently no specific regulations governing online gambling in PA, but this is likely to change soon. Until then, Pennsylvania is a great place to gamble online, especially for residents of other states with stricter laws.</p>
<h1 id="Is-it-legal-to-gamble-online-in-your-state"><a href="#Is-it-legal-to-gamble-online-in-your-state" class="headerlink" title="Is it legal to gamble online in your state?"></a>Is it legal to gamble online in your state?</h1><p>Gambling online is a popular pastime for many people across the United States. However, there are laws that restrict or prohibit gambling in some states. So, is it legal to gamble online in your state?</p>
<p>In most cases, the answer is yes. There are few federal laws that govern gambling, and they do not apply to most forms of online gambling. State laws vary, but most states do not have any laws specifically prohibiting gambling online.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions. Some states prohibit certain types of online gambling, like sports betting or poker. And in a few states, it is technically illegal to gamble online, but the law is not enforced. So, if you’re not sure whether gambling online is legal in your state, it’s best to check with an attorney.</p>
<p>Despite being legal in most states, online gambling can still be risky. There are no guarantees when playing any form of casino game or betting on sports. So, if you’re thinking about gambling online, be sure to do your research and understand the risks involved.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-I-gamble-online-legally-in-my-state"><a href="#How-do-I-gamble-online-legally-in-my-state" class="headerlink" title="How do I gamble online legally in my state?"></a>How do I gamble online legally in my state?</h1><p>This is a question that a lot of people ask, and the answer can vary from state to state. For example, in Nevada gambling online is legal, while it is not in New York. So, the first step is to determine whether or not online gambling is legal in your state.</p>
<p>Once you have ascertained that online gambling is legal in your state, the next step is to find an online casino that is licensed and regulated in that jurisdiction. Most reputable online casinos are licensed in multiple jurisdictions, so this should not be too difficult.</p>
<p>Once you have found a reputable online casino, you will need to create an account and make a deposit. The best way to do this is to use a trusted payment processor such as Visa or Mastercard.</p>
<p>When you are ready to start playing, you can simply log into your account and choose your favourite game. You can also try out some new games by playing for free in demo mode.</p>
<p>If you win money while gambling online, you will need to withdraw it from your account and then transfer it to your bank account or use a payment processor such as PayPal or Skrill.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that gambling can be addictive, so please gamble responsibly.</p>

        <h1 id="7-Means-Lose-at-Casino-–-How-to-Avoid-This"><a href="#7-Means-Lose-at-Casino-–-How-to-Avoid-This" class="headerlink" title="7 Means Lose at Casino – How to Avoid This"></a>7 Means Lose at Casino – How to Avoid This</h1><p>There are many myths in the casino world, and one of the most prevalent is that 7 is a lucky number. In fact, this could not be further from the truth as it’s actually one of the worst numbers to bet on. If you want to avoid losing at casino, then it’s important to understand why this is the case and how you can counteract it.</p>
<p>The reason that 7 is such a bad number to bet on is because it’s associated with low payouts. In other words, you are far more likely to lose money when betting on 7 than any other number. This is especially true if you are playing roulette, where 7 accounts for more than a quarter of all potential losses.</p>
<p>If you want to increase your chances of winning at casino, then it’s important to avoid betting on 7. There are plenty of other numbers that offer better odds, so there is no reason to take the risk. Instead, focus on bets that have a higher payout and are more likely to result in a win.</p>
<h1 id="7-is-the-Most-Common-Number-in-Slot-Machine-Losses"><a href="#7-is-the-Most-Common-Number-in-Slot-Machine-Losses" class="headerlink" title="7 is the Most Common Number in Slot Machine Losses"></a>7 is the Most Common Number in Slot Machine Losses</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. They are also one of the games with the lowest chances of winning. This is due, in part, to the house edge that casinos enjoy on these games. But, another reason for this is that slot machines tend to pay out more on lower amounts than they do on higher amounts.</p>
<p>This means that, statistically, players are more likely to lose while playing a slot machine than they are to win. One study even found that the number 7 is the most common number when it comes to slot machine losses. Out of a sample of 2 million spins, 7 was the number that came up most often in losses.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this number does not come up as frequently when it comes to wins. In fact, only 3% of all wins were for amounts ending in 7. So why does this number crop up so often when it comes to losses?</p>
<p>One theory is that it has something to do with how our brains perceive numbers. Our brains tend to group numbers together and see them as patterns. So, when we see a number like 7 come up often in losses, our brains start to associate that number with losing money. This then causes us to be more likely to bet on other numbers in the hopes of avoiding a loss.</p>
<p>While there is no surefire way to beat the house edge on slot machines, understanding why certain numbers are more common than others can help you make more informed choices about where to place your bets.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machines-Favoring-7-Could-Be-machines-rigged-against-players"><a href="#Slot-Machines-Favoring-7-Could-Be-machines-rigged-against-players" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machines Favoring 7 Could Be machines rigged against players"></a>Slot Machines Favoring 7 Could Be machines rigged against players</h1><p>Slot machines have a history of payout rates that are not always in favor of the player. The chances of winning could be lower than what is advertised, and casinos may be using slot machine software to favor sevens over other symbols.</p>
<p>There is some controversy around how often slot machines actually payout. While the house edge is generally known, it’s difficult to know how much each spin will return on average. Unlike table games where you can see the odds and calculate your probability of winning before you even start playing, slots are largely a game of chance. With this in mind, there have been instances where casinos have been caught rigging their machines to payout less frequently on certain symbols–including sevens.</p>
<p>In 2001, for example, the state of Missouri filed a lawsuit against 11 different casinos for using secret software that reduced payouts on video poker machines when three or four 7s appeared on the screen at once. Casinos were deliberately programming these machines to payout less frequently on certain combinations in order to increase their profits.</p>
<p>While Missouri was successful in its lawsuit and managed to win back millions of dollars for players who had been cheated, this type of fraud is difficult to detect. It’s not as if casinos put up a sign telling players that they’re purposely manipulating the odds against them. More often than not, it’s only through careful analysis of payout rates that any irregularities can be uncovered.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that all slot machines are rigged against players, but it is something worth keeping in mind when choosing which games to play. If you really want to increase your chances of winning, stick to table games where you can see the odds and make informed decisions about your bet size.</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-Love-When-You-Play-7-–-Know-why-before-you-gamble"><a href="#Casinos-Love-When-You-Play-7-–-Know-why-before-you-gamble" class="headerlink" title="Casinos Love When You Play 7 – Know why before you gamble!"></a>Casinos Love When You Play 7 – Know why before you gamble!</h1><p>Casinos love it when you play 7 because the house edge is so much higher on other numbers. But, do you know why?</p>
<p>Simply put, the odds are stacked in favour of the casino for most other bets, but not when you bet on 7. This makes it one of the smartest bets you can make in a casino setting and is one of the reasons why casinos promote this game heavily.</p>
<p>The mathematics behind it are quite straightforward. There are 36 possible outcomes from rolling two dice and six of these come up as 7. This means that there is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a 7 and therefore a 5 in 36 chance of not rolling a 7. The house edge on other bets is typically around 1 percent but jumps to 16.7 percent on betting on 7. This huge swing in advantage makes it well worth your while to focus your gameplay around this number.</p>
<p>Of course, there is still some risk involved as you could easily roll another number instead of 7 and lose your bet. However, the odds are significantly in your favour when playing this simple game so make sure you take advantage!</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-7-Mean-in-Gambling-Terms"><a href="#What-Does-7-Mean-in-Gambling-Terms" class="headerlink" title="What Does -7 Mean in Gambling Terms?"></a>What Does -7 Mean in Gambling Terms?</h1><p>In gambling terms, the number -7 usually represents the expected value of a bet. This number is based on the assumption that the player will make the best possible decisions with their money in order to achieve the highest possible return.</p>
<p>When it comes to gambling, -7 indicates that the player can expect to lose seven units for every one unit they win. This number takes into account all possible outcomes of a bet, including both those that result in a win and those that result in a loss. In other words, this number tells players how much they can expect to lose on average for each bet that they make.</p>
<p>While -7 may not seem like great odds, it’s important to remember that these numbers are never guaranteed. In fact, there’s always the possibility of losing more than seven units for every one unit won. With this in mind, it’s important for players to only gamble with money that they can afford to lose.</p>
<p>Understanding gambling odds and expectations is essential for any player looking to make wise bets. By knowing what to expect, players can avoid costly mistakes and walk away with more of their hard-earned money in hand.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Holds-Out-on-Payout-for-Over-a-Month"><a href="#Casino-Holds-Out-on-Payout-for-Over-a-Month" class="headerlink" title="Casino Holds Out on Payout for Over a Month!"></a>Casino Holds Out on Payout for Over a Month!</h1><p>In what can only be considered as an extremely rare move, a casino has withheld payouts for customers who have won over a month ago. The casino, which has not been named, is allegedly claiming that their software providers are to blame for the issue.</p>
<p>While some customers have been paid out in full, many others have only received a fraction of the money they are owed. In some cases, people have yet to see a dime. The casino has so far failed to provide any reasonable explanation for the discrepancy in payments.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, the casino issued a statement saying: “We are currently in the midst of working with our software providers to resolve an issue that is impacting payouts. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and we appreciate your patience as we work to rectify this situation.”</p>
<p>While it’s certainly possible that there is an issue with the software providers, many people feel as though the casino is simply trying to find a way out of paying out large sums of money. After all, if there were really an issue with the software providers, wouldn’t all customers be experiencing payout delays?</p>
<p>It’s unclear what, if anything, customers can do to get their money back. Many are calling on casinos regulators to step in and investigate the situation, but so far nothing has been done. In the meantime, players are urged to be cautious about playing at this or any other casino until more is known about what’s going on.</p>
<h1 id="Legitimate-Casino-Takes-Nearly-Two-Months-to-Process-Payouts"><a href="#Legitimate-Casino-Takes-Nearly-Two-Months-to-Process-Payouts" class="headerlink" title="Legitimate Casino Takes Nearly Two Months to Process Payouts"></a>Legitimate Casino Takes Nearly Two Months to Process Payouts</h1><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.legitimatecasino.com">Legitimate Casino</a> claims to have the fastest payout times in the business, but our findings show that it can actually take nearly two months for payouts to be processed.</p>
<p>We conducted a test of the Legitimate Casino’s payout times by requesting a withdrawal on October 1st and tracking its progress. Our results showed that the payout was not processed until December 2nd - a full 57 days after we initially requested it!</p>
<p>This is well beyond what is advertised on the Legitimate Casino website, where they claim that payouts will be processed within “48 hours or less.” In fact, their terms and conditions even boast of a “72-hour payout guarantee” which clearly was not met in our case.</p>
<p>When we contacted customer service about our issue, they were apologetic and offered us a bonus code as compensation. However, this did nothing to address the fact that our payout took more than two months to go through.</p>
<p>Thus, we would not recommend using the Legitimate Casino for your online gambling needs, as their slow payout times are likely to cause frustration and delays. Instead, check out one of the many other casinos that offer instant payouts - you’ll be much happier with the results.</p>
<h1 id="How-Long-Will-It-Take-for-My-Casino-Winnings-to-Be-Paid-Out"><a href="#How-Long-Will-It-Take-for-My-Casino-Winnings-to-Be-Paid-Out" class="headerlink" title="How Long Will It Take for My Casino Winnings to Be Paid Out?"></a>How Long Will It Take for My Casino Winnings to Be Paid Out?</h1><p>Casino winnings can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to be paid out, depending on the casino’s payout policy and your method of payment. If you have won a large jackpot, you may have to wait a bit longer for the payout, as the casino may need to verify your winnings.</p>
<p>In most cases, your casino winnings will be paid out via check or bank transfer. Some casinos also allow you to withdraw cash at the casino cage. If you choose to receive a check, it may take a bit longer for the funds to clear, as checks can sometimes take up to two weeks to be processed. Bank transfers usually take just a few days, but may be subject to fees from your bank.</p>
<p>If you are looking for quicker payouts, some online casinos offer instant payouts via e-wallet services like PayPal or Skrill. These payouts are usually processed within minutes of requesting them. However, there may be additional processing fees associated with using such services.</p>
<p>Overall, it typically takes about one week for casino winnings to be paid out. However, it is best to check with the casino beforehand to get an accurate estimate of how long your payout will take.</p>
<h1 id="Can-an-Online-Casino-Legally-Withhold-Your-Winnings-for-a-Month-or-More"><a href="#Can-an-Online-Casino-Legally-Withhold-Your-Winnings-for-a-Month-or-More" class="headerlink" title="Can an Online Casino Legally Withhold Your Winnings for a Month or More?"></a>Can an Online Casino Legally Withhold Your Winnings for a Month or More?</h1><p>When you win money at an online casino, the last thing you expect is for the casino to hold on to your winnings for a month or more. But did you know that this is actually a common practice among some casinos? In fact, some casinos will withhold your winnings for up to two months!</p>
<p>It’s not exactly clear why some casinos do this, but some players speculate that it’s a way to avoid paying out large sums of money. Others believe that the casinos are trying to create a false sense of urgency so that players will gamble more in the hopes of winning back their money.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it’s important to be aware of this before you start playing at any online casino. If you’re not comfortable with the idea of having your winnings withheld for an extended period of time, then be sure to choose a casino that doesn’t engage in this practice.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Speed-Up-the-Time-It-Takes-for-an-Online-Casino-to-Pay-Out-Your-Winnings"><a href="#How-to-Speed-Up-the-Time-It-Takes-for-an-Online-Casino-to-Pay-Out-Your-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How to Speed Up the Time It Takes for an Online Casino to Pay Out Your Winnings"></a>How to Speed Up the Time It Takes for an Online Casino to Pay Out Your Winnings</h1><p>There is nothing more frustrating than waiting for a long time to receive your winnings from an online casino. You might be wondering how you can speed up the process. In this article, we will provide you with tips on how to do just that. </p>
<p>Tip #1: Make sure you are playing at a reputable casino.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why payouts can take a long time is because not all casinos are reputable. If you are playing at a shady casino, there is a good chance that your payout will be delayed. So, make sure you are playing at a reputable casino that has a good reputation for paying out players quickly. </p>
<p>Tip #2: Check your account regularly.</p>
<p>Another reason why payouts can take a long time is because the casino might be waiting for all of the payments to come in before processing them. To avoid this, be sure to check your account regularly to see if there are any pending payments. If you see one, contact customer service and ask them what is taking so long. </p>
<p>Tip #3: Use one of the many payout methods available.</p>
<p>Not all casinos offer the same payout methods. So, if you want to speed up the process, be sure to use one of the many payout methods that are available. Some of the most popular methods include e-wallets, bank transfers, and cheques. </p>
<p>Tip #4: Provide accurate information when requesting a payout.</p>
<p>When requesting a payout from an online casino, it is important to provide accurate information. This includes your name, address, date of birth, and proof of identification. If you do not provide accurate information, your payout could be delayed even further. </p>
<p>Tip #5: Keep an eye on withdrawal limits.</p>
<p>Some casinos have withdrawal limits in place which can slow down the payment process. So, be sure to keep an eye on these limits and try to avoid them if possible. </p>
<p>Now that you know how to speed up the time it takes for an online casino to pay out your winnings, go ahead and try out some of these tips!</p>

        <h1 id="Hawks-Players-Take-Taxis-To-Viejas-Casino"><a href="#Hawks-Players-Take-Taxis-To-Viejas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Hawks Players Take Taxis To Viejas Casino"></a>Hawks Players Take Taxis To Viejas Casino</h1><p>It’s been a gambling excursion of a lifetime for the Atlanta Hawks.</p>
<p>On two separate occasions in the past week, players from the team have taken taxis to Viejas Casino and Resort in San Diego County, according to public records. The first trip took place on Feb. 9, while the second trek was on Feb. 11.</p>
<p>The cost of each round-trip taxi ride was $272.80, totaling $545.60 for both trips.</p>
<p>Most of the Hawks players are from the Los Angeles area and Viejas is a popular destination for Southern California residents looking to gamble. The casino is about an hour-and-a-half drive from downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<h1 id="taxi-from-el-cajon-to-viejas-casino-is-32"><a href="#taxi-from-el-cajon-to-viejas-casino-is-32" class="headerlink" title="taxi from el cajon to viejas casino is $32"></a>taxi from el cajon to viejas casino is $32</h1><p>The taxi from El Cajon to Viejas Casino is $32. The drive is about 15 minutes long, and the casino is a great destination for a night out. There are plenty of restaurants and gaming options available, so you’ll never run out of things to do.</p>
<h1 id="Hawks-Pay-32-For-Taxi-Ride-To-Viejas-Casino"><a href="#Hawks-Pay-32-For-Taxi-Ride-To-Viejas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Hawks Pay $32 For Taxi Ride To Viejas Casino"></a>Hawks Pay $32 For Taxi Ride To Viejas Casino</h1><p>The Atlanta Hawks basketball team had a bit of a gambling problem over the weekend. The team, which is in the middle of a road trip, stopped in San Diego for a game against the Clippers on Saturday. The next day, the Hawks were in nearby Viejas Casino, where they reportedly lost $32 on a single taxi ride.</p>
<p>According to TMZ Sports, the Hawks were seen piling into a taxi outside the casino and heading to their hotel. They only made it about four blocks before losing all their money on the ride. It’s unclear how much each individual player lost, but it was enough to bankrupt the team.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that professional athletes have lost piles of money at casinos. In fact, it’s become something of a stereotype in the sports world. But that doesn’t make it any less embarrassing when it happens.</p>
<p>The Hawks are currently in last place in the Eastern Conference and could use some financial stability. This casino visit is not going to help them get there.</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-Hawks-take-taxi-to-Viejas-Casino"><a href="#Atlanta-Hawks-take-taxi-to-Viejas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta Hawks take taxi to Viejas Casino"></a>Atlanta Hawks take taxi to Viejas Casino</h1><p>The Atlanta Hawks took a taxi to Viejas Casino Wednesday night. The Hawks had a team dinner at Seasons 52 in the UTC area and then took a taxi to the casino.</p>
<p>No one on the Hawks organization is talking about why they took the taxi to the casino, but it’s clear that they were looking for some fun after a disappointing loss to the Utah Jazz.</p>
<p>“We had a team dinner and then we decided to take a taxi over to the casino,” said Kent Bazemore. “It was a lot of fun. We had a great time.”</p>
<p>The Hawks are in the midst of a tough stretch in their schedule, and it’s clear that they were looking for some fun distractions. They’ll need to get back to work on Thursday as they prepare for their game against the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<h1 id="Taxi-ride-from-el-cajon-to-Viejas-casino-is-32"><a href="#Taxi-ride-from-el-cajon-to-Viejas-casino-is-32" class="headerlink" title="Taxi ride from el cajon to Viejas casino is $32"></a>Taxi ride from el cajon to Viejas casino is $32</h1><p>I took a taxi ride from el cajon to Viejas casino and the cost was $32. The drive took about 20 minutes and I was very pleased with the service. I would definitely recommend this taxi company to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable ride.</p>
